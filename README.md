By default, a bucket policy that enforces encrypted inflight operations and 
object uploads is applied to the bucket. In the case that further statements
need to be applied, there are two methods that can be used:
- A `bucket_policy_template` can be provided that will receive
  `deny_unencrypted_object_upload_fragment` and
  `deny_unencrypted_inflight_operations_fragment`
  statement fragments along with the `bucket_name` and the resulting policy
  will be used instead.
- A `source_policy_json` can be provided and the additional statements will
  be added to this policy before being attached to the bucket

The provided `tags` map, when present will be merged with a compulsory tags map 
containing a `Name` tag equal to the bucket name.
  

### Outputs

| Name        | Description                    |
|-------------|--------------------------------|
| bucket_name | The name of the created bucket |

Development
-----------

### Machine Requirements

In order for the build to run correctly, a few tools will need to be installed on your
development machine:

* Ruby (2.7.5)
* Bundler
* git
* git-crypt
* gnupg
* direnv

#### Mac OS X Setup

Installing the required tools is best managed by [homebrew](http://brew.sh).

To install homebrew:

```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Then, to install the required tools:

```
# ruby
brew install rbenv
brew install ruby-build
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init - bash)"' >> ~/.bash_profile
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init - zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
eval "$(rbenv init -)"
rbenv install 2.7.5
rbenv rehash
rbenv local 2.7.5
gem install bundler

# git, git-crypt, gnupg
brew install git
brew install git-crypt
brew install gnupg

# direnv
brew install direnv
echo "$(direnv hook bash)" >> ~/.bash_profile
echo "$(direnv hook zsh)" >> ~/.zshrc
eval "$(direnv hook $SHELL)"

direnv allow <repository-directory>
```

### Running the build

To provision module infrastructure, run tests and then destroy that infrastructure,
execute:

```bash
./go
```

To provision the module contents:

```bash
./go deployment:harness:provision[<deployment_identifier>]
```

To destroy the module contents:

```bash
./go deployment:harness:destroy[<deployment_identifier>]
```

### Common Tasks

#### Managing CircleCI keys

To encrypt a GPG key for use by CircleCI:

```bash
openssl aes-256-cbc \
  -e \
  -md sha1 \
  -in ./config/secrets/ci/gpg.private \
  -out ./.circleci/gpg.private.enc \
  -k "<passphrase>"
```

To check decryption is working correctly:

```bash
openssl aes-256-cbc \
  -d \
  -md sha1 \
  -in ./.circleci/gpg.private.enc \
  -k "<passphrase>"
```
